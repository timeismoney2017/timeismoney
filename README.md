# Time is Money

"Time is Money" is a one-button productivity app to track time spent doing various tasks. The results are saved via H2(Spring-Hibernate) database to be viewed later. The intention of the app is to fascilitate time tracking events ranging from client interactions to time spent at the grocery store. The hope is that people will be able to easily collect data on themselves so that they can have a better idea of how they are spending their time.

## Getting Started

Download the app from the app store and select a spreadsheet to start writing to. Each start/stop sequence will create an entry in that spreadsheet.
